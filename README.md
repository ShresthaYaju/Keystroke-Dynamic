# Keystroke-Dynamic

Keystroke Dynamic is a GitHub repository that explores a new way of biometric authentication using keystroke dynamics. We have built a neural network model on a custom-collected dataset that can identify individuals based on their typing patterns. This project takes into account several factors to create a reliable and secure biometric authentication system.
